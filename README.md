# HatTip

Ever attend a hack day and never meet anyone? HatTip is a way to encourage everyone to 
meet each other and strengthen their personal networks.

# How it works

1. Install the application
2. Create a profile for yourself.
3. Create an Event
4. See a list of attendees and start to meet them!

## Stories

A user should be able to install the application
A user should be able to store their first name in their profile
A user should be able to store their last name in their profile
A user should be able to join an event
A user should be able see a list of attendees at the event
A user should be able to mark an attendee as "met"
-------- critical stories are above this line ----------

## Assumptions

* User profile will be stored using data persistence
* Event will be hard-coded, and also stored using persistence

## Questions

## TODO


http put using curl... put the user profile info to the event, including the IP address
